This is a very informal design document :D

Parts of power grid:


Resource Market
    -> Oil Resource Pool
    -> Coal Resource Pool
    -> Trash Resource Pool
    -> Uranium Resource Pool

Resource Pool
    -> Resource Type
    -> Total Resources
    -> Resources available
    -> Replenish rate
    -> Game Phase
    -> Num Players

Resource type
    -> Coal
    -> Oil
    -> Trash
    -> Uranium
    -> Renewable



Board:
    -> City Graph
    -> Area Graph
    -> Player Order
    -> Player-City mapping

Player:
    -> Cities owned
    -> Plants owned
    -> Current electro

    -> Power cities
    -> Bid for plant
    -> Buy cities
    -> Buy resources

    -> Strategize

Stratagem:

Strategy:
    -> Relevant phases
    -> Relevant round
    -> Needs board state
    -> Create adjustment factor

Plant Market
    -> Current Market
        -> Plants
    -> Future Market
        -> Plants
    -> Plant Deck
    -> Game Phase


Moderator
    -> Player list
    -> Shuffle deck
    -> Replenish markets
    -> Remove Plant
    -> Add Plant
    -> Check for next phase






Initial algorithm:
1. Create players
2. Shuffle plants
3. Generate market
4. Fill resources
5. Determine player order
6.
