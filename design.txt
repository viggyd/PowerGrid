This is a very informal design document :D

Parts of power grid:




Resource Pool
    a: Resource Type
    a: Total Resources
    a: Resources available
    m: Buy resources
    m: Replenish resources
    m: Get available resources to buy

Resource Market
    a: Oil Resource Pool
    a: Coal Resource Pool
    a: Trash Resource Pool
    a: Uranium Resource Pool

    m: Buy resources
    m: Replenish resources
    m: Get available resources

Resource type
    -> Coal
    -> Oil
    -> Trash
    -> Uranium
    -> Renewable



Board:
    -> City Graph
    -> Area Graph
    -> Player Order
    -> Player-City mapping



Player Board:

    Although in PowerGrid, a player does not have a specific board that is theirs,
    like in Viticulture, there is undeniably a board state for each player. For
    the purposes of our initial analysis, this board is all we really need.
    Everything else will be strategy. The board, for example, is not allowed to see
    what the actual/future markets are. That is the job of the intelligence behind
    the board.

    In this manner, I again try to separate policy from mechanism.

    a: Cities owned
    a: Plants owned
    a: Current elektro
    a: Max plants allowed

    m: Get number of cities
    m: Remove elektro
    
    

    Phase 2: Auction Power Plants
    m: Get power plants
    m: Add plant to board
    m: Replace plant
    
    Phase 3: Buying Resources
    m: Get resources on each plant
    m: Add resources to plant

    Phase 4: Building
    m: Add cities to network

    Phase 5: Bureaucracy
    m: Remove resources from plant
    m: Get elektro for plants powered
    

Player:
    Note, starred items are strategies.

    As awkward as it is, the player needs references to the resource market,
    the plant market, the board, and the moderator.
    They won't have access to the important functions.

    It's important to note the distinction between a player's board state and
    the actual player intelligence. This class sort of melds both together
    because it is difficult to separate the two. For example, the player's
    board state will have the number of plants, the plants, the resources, etc.
    But it won't do any of the strategy. That, in the analysis case, is the job
    of the simulator, but eventually will be the job of the AI.

    As with everything else, it will not be up to the user to determine the policy.
    Only the mechanism.

    One of the problems

    a: Cities owned
    a: Plants owned
    a: Current elektro
    a: Max plants allowed

    a: Total money spent in round
    a: Total money earned in round

    m: Reset money spent/earned

    Phase 1: Determine player order
    m: Get number of cities

    Phase 2: Auction Power Plants
    a: Plant purchased this round
    a: Money spent on plant
    m: Should I try to buy a plant?*
    m: See actual market
    m: See future market
    m: Auction plant
    m: Bid for plant
    m: Pass

    Phase 3: Buying Resources
    a: Money spent on resources
    m: Check needed resources based on plants
    m: Buy resources
    m: Determine cost of resources vs. money from cities*


    Phase 4: Building
    a: Money spent on cities
    m: Buy cities

    Phase 5: Bureaucracy
    a: Money earned
    m: Determine cities to power*
    m: Power cities
    m: Get money from powering cities
    m: Calculate the amount of money from powering plants*



    -> Strategize

Stratagem:

Strategy:
    -> Relevant phases
    -> Relevant round
    -> Needs board state
    -> Create adjustment factor

Plant Market
    -> Current Market
        -> Plants
    -> Future Market
        -> Plants
    -> Game Phase


Moderator
    a: Player list
    a: Power Plant Deck
    a: Resource Market
    a: Plant Market
    a: Player order


    -> Shuffle deck
    -> Replenish markets
    -> Remove Plant
    -> Add Plant
    -> Check for next phase






Initial algorithm:
1. Create players
2. Shuffle plants
3. Generate market
4. Fill resources
5. Determine player order
6.




How much should a player pay for a plant in an auction?
